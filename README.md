# Walkability and Health
For a class project I wanted to evaluate the correlation of how walkable a neighborhood is and the health outcomes in that neighborhood. 
I hypothesized that communites that are more walkable will be realtively healthier than communites that are less walkable. Individual level data was not availble to me at the time of this analysis.
I used the percentage of presons walking to work as a proxy measure for walkability. Using linear regression and controling for many covariates I analyzed the effect of walking to work on the percentage of coronary heart disease in a census tract
